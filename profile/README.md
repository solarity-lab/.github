# ☀️ Solarity Labs

**Solarity Labs** is an independent technology organization focused on
**low-level systems**, **programming languages**, and **runtime internals**.

We build software for people who want to understand how computers actually work —
from memory and execution models to interpreters and virtual machines.

We value **technical depth**, **clarity**, and **long-term sustainability**
over trends and surface-level abstractions.

---

## 🎯 Focus Areas

- Programming languages and interpreters
- Virtual machines and runtime systems
- Memory management and garbage collection
- System-level foundations and tooling

Our work is driven by curiosity and a desire to understand systems from
first principles.

## 🧪 Projects

### 🔧 Suny
A small programming language written in **pure C**, designed to explore
how interpreters, VMs, and language runtimes work internally.

**Suny** is built with the goal of being:
- readable
- hackable
- educational
- free of hidden layers or magic

It is not optimized for production use, but for learning and experimentation.

## 🧠 Philosophy

- Learn by building, not by memorizing
- Prefer explicit systems over opaque abstractions
- Understand the machine, not just the language
- Software should be technically sustainable, not trend-driven

We believe good tools come from deep understanding, not shortcuts.
